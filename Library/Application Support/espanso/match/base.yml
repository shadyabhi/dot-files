# espanso match file

# For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/

# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.
matches:
  # Simple text replacement
  - trigger: ":anki"
    replace: "> [!anki]- "

  - trigger: ":info"
    replace: "> [!info]- \n"

  - trigger: ":imp"
    replace: "💡💡💡 "

  - trigger: ":wtf"
    replace: "❓❓❓ "

  - trigger: ":cl"
    replace: "- [ ] "

  - trigger: ":apps"
    replace: "cd /export/content/lid/apps/"

  # Print the current date
  - trigger: ":date"
    replace: "{{mydate}}"
    vars:
      - name: mydate
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%:z"

  # Print the output of a shell command
  - trigger: ":shell"
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
      - name: output
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "echo 'Hello from your shell'"
